# Shared USB protocol plots

Development groundwork for [#4831](https://github.com/dancxjo/conduit/issues/4831).
This directory is below portable application meaning. Its inputs describe USB
wire facts; its calculations neither discover devices nor grant authority.
The hardware boundary follows
[#4833](https://github.com/dancxjo/conduit/issues/4833): Rust owns physics-facing
primitives and invariants; plots own protocols. Controller setup/teardown,
bounded endpoint/control transfers, DMA lifetime, interrupt acknowledgement,
resource enforcement and mandatory local safety may remain below plots.
Descriptor interpretation, class recognition, report decoding, control request
construction, PCM negotiation and framing, Ethernet framing, and protocol retry
policy belong in reviewed plots. An endpoint provider must not conceal a class
driver behind a generic-looking gear.

This USB slice does not absorb #4833's I2C/BME280 acceptance. Portable binary
composition developed here should serve that later slice too: checked integer
widening preserves the entire source domain, and packed-word helpers are bounded
groundwork rather than a substitute for reusable bounded byte/frame contracts.
Probe plots consume an already-admitted attachment; recognizing a class never
mints authority or selects a host resource.

`protocol.conduit` currently owns endpoint address arithmetic, interface-class
recognition, boot keyboard/mouse octet extraction, control setup construction,
reusable ring positions/cycles, PCM packet cadence and completion correlation.
Packed words contain little-endian wire octets. The U64 representation is a
finite arithmetic representation, not a physical pointer or capability.
Signed mouse motion is interpreted separately from octet extraction.

The register-leaf groundwork in `src/machine_membrane` validates existing opaque
Base possession before an aligned, bounded 32-bit access. Native composition
must bind the exact already-admitted device-memory mapping and revoke possession
before unmapping. Its cooperative fixture is not hostile-code containment. CPU
ordering is distinct from mapping attributes and DMA cache maintenance.

`plots/machine/register32.conduit` builds the primitive requests and calls the
register Kind through ordinary checked topology. Revision 2 of the register Host
Call takes exactly 16 canonical U128 bytes: offset, value, operation and reserved
bits; its result is exactly four U32 bytes. The provider rejects malformed words
and wrong node/call bindings before access. Production preparation binds a sealed
Plan fragment, canonical active Play, selected Base/provider, authority/resource
and the complete ordinary numeric lowering, including its call, routing, storage
and terminal tables. The kernel Host Call back is shared with pure expressions;
there is no separate machine scheduler. Fixtures prove repeated calls, output
pressure, typed denial, revocation and rejection of late cancelled completions.

A register window alone does not confine DMA or enforce mandatory device safety.
The trusted native mapping owner must enforce those invariants independently.
USB class plots consume class-neutral bounded transfers; they must not be given
arbitrary controller-register programming authority.

`src/usb_base/control_request` validates an immutable eight-octet setup word
and a borrowed bounded OUT payload on every architecture. It preserves class
opcodes and request parameters without probe policy. Direction/length checks
reject extra IN payload and mismatched OUT payload. The native x86_64 control
module consumes this same input and independently enforces its actual DMA
buffer size; a broader request bound cannot broaden that storage. Legacy
enumeration still constructs its requests in Rust, as migration debt. This raw
input seam does not install a USB Host Call, grant endpoint possession or prove
asynchronous cancellation, reusable rings, class execution or native OUT-data
device compatibility. Those require the remaining stack work below.

Native control completion retains a short Data Stage residue until the final
Status Stage succeeds; status success cannot replace the actual data count.
Duplicate stages, foreign slot/endpoint identities and malformed counts remain
distinct refusals. The legacy descriptor read overrequests 64 octets and still
requires exactly 18 returned descriptor octets. The x86_64 emulator proof now
requires an observed short transfer, followed by successful status and device
configuration. This demonstrates native stage handling, not plotted enumeration
or cancellation/quiescence proof.

## Check the groundwork

```sh
cargo xtask make conduitos usb-plots-check
cargo xtask make conduitos usb-plots-check --cross
```

The first command checks/expands the source and executes deterministic wire and
register-possession fixtures. The second also type-checks the shared library for
x86_64, IA-32, AArch64, RISC-V64 and LoongArch64. The IA-32 check uses the installed
UEFI Rust target; it is not a BIOS image or product boot check. Both commands
require the checkout's pinned toolchain; cross checks require those Rust target
libraries to be installed. No target is silently skipped.

Tests cover endpoint identity, exact setup bytes, signed mouse edges, fractional
PCM packet cadence, ring-cycle reuse, bounds, stale Boot and revocation. Neither
command establishes USB controller execution, device playback, Ethernet traffic,
physical behavior, or stable acceptance.

## Remaining implementation

The protocol calculations and register definition are not installed product
device offers. Register calls execute through the production kernel in a
cooperative mapping fixture; native composition has not bound a real admitted
controller resource or installed its advertisement/dispatcher. The following
work remains under the owning issue:

- product machine/USB offers, native dispatcher and actual resource integration;
- a class-neutral bounded USB transfer base with distinct short/malformed,
  pressure, cancellation, provider-loss and stale-attachment outcomes;
- finite DMA/coherence/interrupt possession and lifecycle;
- shared controller discovery, enumeration, descriptors and alternate interfaces;
- control and reusable interrupt/bulk/isochronous transfer plots;
- keyboard transition validation/delivery and mouse semantic mapping;
- negotiated USB Audio Class PCM playback, pressure, underrun, drain and loss;
- CDC-ECM networking through the existing network semantic seam;
- CDC-ACM serial and mass-storage bulk-only transport with separate acceptance;
- architecture-specific mapping/coherence/interrupt leaves and real emulator
  execution of the same class plots on each supported product target.

The existing x86_64 Rust USB/HID stack remains the current product implementation
until replacement plots earn execution proof. Sharing arithmetic is useful
foundation; it does not establish driver parity.

For #4833's migration audit, the existing xHCI mapping, DMA/ring ownership,
interrupt acknowledgement and controller lifecycle are base/invariant work.
USB descriptor decoding, HID report interpretation, probe/class selection and
FTDI command/framing behavior are protocol work retained as temporary
implementation debt until equivalent plot execution is proven. This is a
responsibility classification, not a claim that current files already enforce
the final boundary. Do not delete the current path or maintain two permanent
protocol implementations. Acceptance must correlate exact source/checked plot,
selected base/resource, Plan/Play and attachment identities with a bounded
transaction transcript and final lifecycle outcome. Emulator execution and
physical/HIL compatibility remain separate proof classes.
